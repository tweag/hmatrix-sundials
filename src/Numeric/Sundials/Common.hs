    -- ^ For each event occurrence, this indicates the time of the
    -- occurrence. Size: max_num_events.

    -- ^ Vector of size 1 that gives the total number of events occurred.

    -- ^ The total number of rows in the output matrix.

    -- ^ Vector of size max_num_events that gives the direction of the

  , c_local_error :: vec CDouble
    -- ^ Vector containing local error estimates. Size: the dimensionality
    -- of the system.

    -- ^ Vector containing variable weights (derived from the tolerances).
    -- Size: the dimensionality of the system.
  , c_local_error_set :: vec CInt
    -- The flag (size 1) indicating whether c_local_error is filled with meaningful
    -- values. *Should be initialized with 0.*
